# Project: Neurosky Brainwave Visualizer

[Overview]

After purchasing a Neurosky Mindwave EEG device, I was surprised to see limited apps for
viewing and visualizing EEG output (brainwave activity for delta, theta, alpha, and beta waves).
Upon discovering 'How to Hack Toy EEGs' (http://frontiernerds.com/brain-hack), I was inspired
by the Processing visualization of the Arduino-based serial output.  I wanted to visualize the
same set of data, however decided to obtain it using Neurosky's published ThinkGear Socket Protocol
(http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_connector_tgc).

This fork of kitschpatrol's original code differs in that it doesn't use the Serial interface
to obtain brainwave data.  Rather, it communicates via the ThinkGear connector using the 
ThinkGear Socket Protocol and requests data in JSON format.

[MindWave/MindSet Communication]

By default the ThinkGear Connector allows applications to connect over TCP (default 127.0.0.1:13854)
and request data in either binary or JSON format.  This application will connect to the ThinkGear socket,
and read the streaming real-time data.  Format:

	{
	"eSense":
		{"attention":91,"meditation":41},
	 "eegPower":
	 	{"delta":1105014,"theta":211310,
	 	"lowAlpha":7730,"highAlpha":68568,
	 	"lowBeta":12949,"highBeta":47455,
	 	"lowGamma":55770,"highGamma":28247},
	 "poorSignalLevel":0
	 }
	 
The default IP and port will be used, unless alternatives are specified as environment variables (THINKGEAR_HOST
and THINKGEAR_PORT).  Port forwarding can be used on the host Windows or Mac computer to allow remote servers to connect.
To allow other hosts to connect and run Processing, run ReplayTCP (http://www.dlcsistemas.com/html/relay_tcp.html)
OR, use netcat (windows or mac) to port forward (clients can now connect to port 13855).  
Ex:  nc -l -p 13855 -c ' nc localhost 13854'
	 
[Required Libraries]

The following required libraries are included:

- ControlP5 (See http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)
- JSON (See http://www.blprnt.com/processing/json.zip)

Make sure to unzip and include under your normal 'sketchbook' libraries folder.  Example directory structure:

	/usr/local/processing/libraries/
	|-- controlP5
	|   `-- library
	|       `-- controlP5.jar
	|-- json
	|   `-- library
	|       `-- json.jar


[Binaries]

Binaries were created using Processing's app builder (platforms = windows, mac & linux)

[Todo]
- Re-visit previous todo from original code
- Add ability to record data (CSV, etc.)
